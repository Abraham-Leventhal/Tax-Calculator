<h2 id="setup">Preliminaries: Kitchen Setup</h2>

<p>You need to setup your computer in certain ways in order to follow
these recipes.  First, follow
<a href="http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/#cli-install-test">these instructions</a> on installing Anaconda and a taxcalc package on
your computer. And second, install the recipes and ingredients in this
cookbook on your computer.  There are several ways to do that.  If you
have cloned the Tax-Calculator repository (see the
<a href="http://taxcalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor_guide.html">
Contributor Guide</a>), then the recipes are located in the
<kbd>Tax-Calculator/docs/cookbook</kbd> directory.  If you haven't
cloned the repository, you have a couple of choices. You can download
the source code as a zip file by clicking on the green <q>Clone or
download</q> button on
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator">
this page</a>. Or you can copy and paste the recipes and ingredients
to your local computer.  If you follow this last option, you may need
to edit file paths in the recipes depending on how you've organized
the copy-and-pasted files.
